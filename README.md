# promy-github-workflows

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows shared across `promy-*` services. Single-purpose repo — `main` only ever changes for CI-infra reasons, so a caller's gate never breaks for reasons unrelated to CI.

## `go-coverage.yml`

Gates a pre-computed coverage profile on `vladopajic/go-test-coverage` and posts a per-package + low-coverage breakdown as a PR comment. It does **not** run your tests — the caller runs `go test -coverprofile=...` itself (with whatever service containers it needs — MySQL, Redis, ...) and uploads the raw profile as an artifact. This keeps the shared workflow decoupled from any repo's service dependencies, and avoids running the test suite twice per CI run.

```yaml
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  # add a `services:` block here if your tests need Redis/MySQL/etc.
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      with:
        go-version-file: go.mod
    - name: Run tests
      run: go test -race -failfast -coverpkg=./... -covermode=atomic -coverprofile=coverage.raw.out -count=1 ./...
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: coverage-profile
        path: coverage.raw.out

coverage:
  needs: test
  uses: tclavelloux/promy-github-workflows/.github/workflows/go-coverage.yml@v1
  with:
    total-threshold: 80
    module-prefix: github.com/tclavelloux/promy-crm/
  secrets: inherit
```

### Inputs

| Input | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `total-threshold` | *(required)* | Fail below this overall coverage % |
| `package-threshold` | `0` | Fail any package below this % (0 = off) |
| `exclude-patterns` | `main.go`, `internal/bootstrap.go`, `cmd/`, `test/mock.go`, `testdata` | Newline-separated regexes dropped from the coverage profile before gating — applies to both the threshold check and the PR comment, so generated/untestable code never pads either. Add repo-specific paths (e.g. `examples/`) as needed. |
| `post-pr-comment` | `true` | Post/refresh the coverage breakdown PR comment |
| `module-prefix` | `""` | Go module prefix stripped from paths in the PR comment, e.g. `github.com/org/repo/` |
| `coverage-artifact` | `coverage-profile` | Name of the artifact uploaded by the caller's `test` job |
| `profile-filename` | `coverage.raw.out` | Filename of the coverage profile inside that artifact |

## `go-lint.yml`

Installs a fixed `golangci-lint` version via `go install` and runs it. This is the single place the fleet's linter version is decided — bumping the `golangci-lint-version` default here is one PR, not six. Deliberately mirrors `go-coverage.yml`'s `workflow_call` shape (same input-description style, same step naming) but installs from source rather than a prebuilt binary, matching `promy-template-go/scripts/golangci-lint.sh` — so "local matches CI" is literally true, not just intended.

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    uses: tclavelloux/promy-github-workflows/.github/workflows/go-lint.yml@v1
```

A reusable workflow is called at the **job** level. It cannot be a `steps:` entry — `uses:` inside `steps:` resolves actions, not workflows.

### Inputs

| Input | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `golangci-lint-version` | `v2.13.2` | Version to install (with or without a leading `v`) |
| `timeout` | `5m` | `golangci-lint --timeout` value. A Go duration string, not a number. |
| `go-version-file` | `go.mod` | Path used to resolve the Go toolchain version |
| `args` | `""` | Extra one-off flags appended to `golangci-lint run`. Repo-wide linter behavior (enabled linters, exclusions, settings) belongs in the caller's own `.golangci.yml` — this input is for one-off flags only. |

Requires only `contents: read` — unlike `go-coverage.yml`, it posts nothing and needs no `pull-requests: write`.

`go-lint.yml` accepts `${{ inputs.* }}` into `run:` steps via an `env:` mapping rather than interpolating them directly into the shell string, specifically to close the shell-injection surface that direct interpolation opens (a caller-controlled `args` or `golangci-lint-version` string could otherwise break out of the intended command). `go-coverage.yml` above interpolates directly and predates this decision — that's an accepted, scoped risk there, not a pattern to copy forward.

If the caller has a `.golangci-version` file (see `promy-template-go`), the workflow emits an `::warning` — never a failure — when it drifts from the resolved `golangci-lint-version`. A warning, not a hard failure, so a version bump here doesn't turn all six repos red until each lands its own PR: that would convert free propagation into six mandatory PRs.

### Versioning

Tag releases (`v1`, `v2`, ...) rather than pinning consumers to `@main` — a breaking change to this workflow should require an explicit opt-in bump in each caller, not a silent flip across every `promy-*` service on the next push.
